If working in wilderness areas (think ""if someone broke their leg at my field site, would it take more than one hour to get them to a hospital?"") ensure that at least one person has training in Wilderness First Aid. In all locations, Mental Health First Aid training will help you recognize signs of depression and suicidality. ","Set clear policies around safety (will anyone work alone? who will carry radios? who can they come to if a community member or team member is making them feel unsafe?) and communicate these clearly. Make sure all crew members know that their safety is more important than the data, that everyone has an emergency number to call, and that they know that no one will be angry if they come back early. 

Keep in mind that some students' identities make them more vulnerable to harassment or violence from landowners and law enforcement. Especially if you do not share these identities, trust their guts--if anyone feels unsafe, you need to listen to that and take it seriously. 

Remember that as a leader, your words carry weight: do not joke about safety or harassment in front of your crew. Your actions speak even louder: respond to even small issues as though someone watching is deciding whether you can be trusted.","Communicate expectations for behavior from the start. ","Praise, praise, praise! The first step in any tough situation--asking for more out of a member or starting to address a dispute--should always be recognizing that the person is doing a hard thing and doing it well. Even when things seem to be going fine, make sure you're explicitly letting people know you appreciate them. Start from the assumption that everyone is trying hard and feels unappreciated for it, and it's your job to fix that. When you model appreciation and assuming good intentions, other team members are more likely to do the same with each other.","It's always good to check in with crew members one on one. Debrief, if only with yourself, any incidents that could have become serious situations, and what you can do to prevent them in the future.","I don't use unpaid student labor. Doing so is exploitative, and contributes to patterns of exclusion--see Jensen et al 2021 in BioScience. Of course grad students usually aren't in charge of these decisions and don't have the funding to provide stipends. (I get around this by applying to lots of small grants to support undergrad research projects, and with creative use of some ""professional development"" funds.) Even when we can't make sure everyone is paid a living wage, we need to advocate for ethical pay practices when we can. ","Everyone was working their asses off in tough conditions, but we knew we could take breaks or ask for schedule changes for any reason and no one would be angry. The leader made time for both time to ourselves and fun bonding activities. ","No one felt appreciated. There was a lot of triangulation (person A talking about their issues with B to C, rather than bringing them up with B directly), most damagingly a supervisor speaking critically of one subordinate to others. This was unprofessional, put us all in a tough position, and undercut trust. Misery was normalized, rather than being seen as a serious problem needing immediate changes and mental health support. ","When you are responsible for other people, you have to take that seriously. This will probably mean watching what you say a bit more, and making decisions about risk differently than you might for yourself. 

Most of all, remember that your well-being and theirs is always, always more important than the data. ","ADVANCEGeo leads a great training specific to fieldwork scenarios! As mentioned before, Wilderness First Aid and Mental Health First Aid classes are a good idea--just look for one near you. Hollaback offers bystander intervention trainings which can be tailored to address specific harassment dynamics.

Exercise (especially strength training--rock climbing is great field prep; a lot of equipment is heavy and awkward and no amount of knowledge or expertise will help you if you throw your back out in the wilderness). Ensure all crew members are aware of exactly kind of environment they're about to commit to and what the types of hazards are (if we're about to disappear off the grid for 3 weeks, you need to know that you can't call your family and you should have wilderness first aid training). Let members know that they will be sent home if they engage in a pattern of unsafe behavior (I had a lead who had a 2-strike policy for life jackets, despite the enormous cost of sending people home early; this sets a dire tone and establishes expectations).","No one is lifting beyond their capacity. When lifting heavy objects, proper form is key. Take all safety concerns seriously, even small offhand comments. Ignoring small comments makes it less likely that someone will speak up in a higher-stakes situation. Actively encourage to speak up when concerned.

Actively invite crew to participate in parts of the planning process to provide both novel ideas, opportunity for critical thinking, and personal investment on the part of the crew member. Speaking to physical safety, data integrity, and interpersonal connections: anyone and everyone on the team should feel comfortable enough to say ""I don't know how to do that."" This requires a culture that is intentionally established as such.","PATIENCE. A crew member doing something ""wrong"" is a teachable moment to explain methodological nuances etc., NOT a time to get upset or frustrated. General behavioral/personality patterns should be saved for after field season; e.g., if a crew member is sloppy with details but loves getting their hands dirty, make them the sampler and have someone else record the data (e.g.). But no one is served by a field lead saying ""you're bad at details,"" especially while in the field, and especially in front of other crew members. Patterns/issues that are pressing enough to address in the field should be done in private (no one feels they have time in the field for private conversations but if it needs to be done, it needs to be done right; doing it wrong can potentially make things much worse). DO NOT HOOK UP WITH OR FLIRT WITH A CREW MEMBER. If necessary, talk about it before the campaign begins to address the necessary power dynamic and how it would affect other crew members (preferential treatment makes for bad vibes in the camp). Even if you flirted in the office, shut it down while you're out. You can pick it up in the off-season. Crew members hooking up or flirting with each other can be fine if they are mature about it and don't let it affect their work. Actively invite voices and opinions in planning any given day; again, this builds buy-in and makes crew feel valued and important. Allow crew to build experience in desired areas (e.g., teach an undergrad to trailer a boat); this builds pride and positive relationships while also developing skills useful to the campaign.","Set aside budget for end-of-season dinner or party (if feasible, pay for first round of drinks out of pocket if institution disallows alcohol purchases). Thank the crew for all their hard work, including acknowledgment that it's not always fun or easy but it's important and interesting work. Compliment their strengths. If necessary, post-season is the time to address frustrations and behavioral patterns observed in the field.","Again, all team members should feel free to ask questions and contribute to planning. In general terms, students are there to learn and to work, whereas assistants are there to work (learning enough to execute tasks as necessary). Students should be assigned a mix of tasks they're familiar with and tasks they don't yet know how to do (strengthening existing skills and learning new ones). Assistants can be assigned tasks they already know, as they are hired to perform labor; all else being equal, the team doesn't need the loss of efficiency associated with teaching an assistant a new skill (although if it's something they're eager to learn, then personal and team morale will benefit from it). Volunteers should be shown as good a time as possible within the parameters of the work, because they're not getting anything else out of it (imagine volunteering for something that drains your soul).","Team camaraderie was incredible. A lot of luck in terms of meshing personality types. However, a productive, team-oriented, and efficiency-minded demeanor is a decision that each member must continue to prioritize in every moment of ever day. Sometimes something happens that you can only laugh or cry about--effective team members must be able to laugh. Everyone felt a sense of personal investment/""buy-in."" Field leads were open to input and easily changed plans when faced with roadblocks or when crew members suggested efficiency tweaks to the plan. Leads understood well that ""if you can do something about it, it's a problem; if you can't do something about it, it's a parameter.""","One pouty team member can ruin a whole team/trip. I'm not sure if this person hates me as a lead (or as a person), hates field work, or is just generally always grumpy. But unwillingness to engage in conversation, snippy/impatient demeanor, and unwillingness to take direction did a few things: 1) work was less efficient because he wouldn't take direction; 2) work was slower because an unhappy team is a slow team; 3) everyone was constantly uncomfortable by virtue of his presence.","1) ""If you can do something about it, it's a problem. If you can't do something about it, it's a parameter."" Be ready to adjust priorities and plans on the fly. 2) Be patient with people, but be firm about safety. 3) Like it or not, being the lead means you're seen as the pro; if you don't know the answer, the best thing you can do is say, ""I don't know, what do you think?"" and workshop the answer from there. 4) Keep an eye on methodological integrity when others are performing sampling tasks; teachable moments don't have to be or feel punitive (a little bit of backseat driving is ok if sample integrity is on the line; just make sure you teach them such that they do it right on their own next time, rather than having to continue to rely on you to be watching). 5) ""It is possible to do everything right and still fail. That is not failure, that is life."" 6) You are the anchor for team culture; people who feel good make a team that works good. 7) Guaranteed, you will make mistakes. That's ok. Learn from them, fix them, and move on. Field season (and your crew) can't wait for you while you feel bad about yourself.","Learn from your mistakes, learn from others' mistakes, learn from your near-misses.","My department in grad school had a workshop every spring for faculty and grad students who do field work. Some review of policy, but mostly playing out scenarios and discussing the merits of different courses of action (everything from ""one member has concerns about the trail ahead but others don't; the alternative is an hour longer"" to ""you hooked up with a subordinate crew member, how do you proceed?"") I found this massively helpful and believe more departments should do this. Open conversation in small groups for each scenario allowed for exchange of ideas, consideration of alternative priorities, and various leadership style.
First aid (or wilderness first aid, depending on site locales) should be required. In addition to being important field prep, this is one of the best methods for team-building prior to the season.","Have fun!"

When the job is not fully compensated monetarily (i.e., maybe some money but not a fair wage and the balance of compensation is experience of some sort) I think it is important to not forgo the non-monetary part of the compensation, this usually equates to added time for teaching or more slowly conduction sampling in order to let the people practice, discuss the process/procedure and maybe reflect on the day's work in greater detail (vs. the essentials or safety, challenges, preparedness).","having an organized plan, being flexible, ability to problem solve, knowing when to step back, pause and adjust.","team of 3 technicians with no manager (i.e. no one assigned lead, all 3 on same level) completing time sensitive sampling program at remote (heli access) site, one team member who didn't want to be there would not contribute but also would not get out of the way of the other two technicians, putting everyone at risk in the field and slowing down the sampling by refusing to work. I think either a manager should have been part of the team or one of the team members put in charge by manager before team went into the field so that leadership was understood beforehand. That being said, this team member was problematic from the beginning and should never have been hired for this position as they lacked the experience and maturity to be part of a team working remotely and independently - they wanted a free trip to the arctic and were not prepared for the hard work, conditions and long shifts (28 days in camp, no rest days).","Do a test run of your field procedures, plan for delays and give yourself time and space to reassess you procedures part way through the season, ask lots of questions of your advisor/s and get a commitment from them as to whether they will join you in the field for any part of your work and how you will communicate with them when you need their input during the field season, select your team carefully (request to be involved in the selection process, you're the one who has to work with these assistants/undergrads afterall), stay dry and bring extra sharpies and batteries. **know how all your equipment works and how to problem solve technical glitches in the field (and when it's time to take your widget back to the lab for assessment).","nothing I can think of.","private sector takes safety very seriously and if there is fieldwork involved discussions about safety task by task are usually part of the SOP, I haven't found university safety documents or discussions to be very practical (they are just concerned with legal coverage). I think taking some pages from the private sector book would be a valuable addition for grad student field leaders, as unless you've been exposed to the private sector in this way these concepts don't come up in many other life experiences - I'm a fan of the Field Level Risk Assessment, it's basically a conversation at the field site prior to start of work that lists the potential risks and what the team will do to mitigate them based on the site, the conditions that day (snowing, hot, windy, etc), and the task at hand (are there any chemicals involved, sharp or otherwise dangerous tools, etc). It just helps put the potential risks at the front of mind (vs. that one safety document you read two months back before you were even out in the field), clarify the task and roles to everyone involved and note any new/unique challenges due to the here and now of the situation. This usually takes 5-10 minutes, and can be as simple as: we're sampling vegetation plots this morning, it is sunny and hot out, we are an hour walk from our vehicle and wildlife in the area include bears - we will wear sunscreen and hats, and stop for water breaks, we will leave by X time to return to the vehicle before dark, we will work in teams of 2 and have 1 bear spray per team and scan the surroundings for wildlife regularly (at least every 15 minutes).

Check in with the crew regularly about how the season is going 2. call off fieldwork/stop for the day based on the comfort of the least comfortable person on the crew (i.e. go back to the truck when a storm is coming in when the person who is most wary about lightening says let's go), 3. make decisions about safety group decisions - i.e. should we drive up or down this rough hill or try to find another way? Do you want to keep working in the heat or should we call it a day and head back to camp?","1. Similar to physical, there needs to be a standard and culture of communication about communication style, boundaries/things people don't want to talk about, etc. 2. do an ice breaker activity where you learn about each other, each other's communication style, etc.","1. maintain a professional environment - it can be hard, but the crew lead should base the amount that they talk about their personal life on how much the crew divulges, and they should shut down personal conversations if things get inappropriate or if it seems like someone is uncomfortable. 2. have regular check ins with crew members individually to see how things are going with you as a crew lead and with the other crew member. 3. do some fun things for the crew in addition to working hard - surprise them with a snack or drink they like in the field (I used La Croix and gluten free baked goods) during hitches, do an office day when they're exhausted instead of going into the field, go out to dinner, etc.","Let your crew know that you are happy to be a reference for them (if you are!). Forward professional opportunties and jobs you see to them if they're interested.","I think that you should generally push less hard on volunteers. For paid assistants, sometimes you need to push a bit and say this is the work, this is what you signed up for, and this is what we need to get done. For volunteers, you shouldn't push as much, because it may turn them off of the field and make them less likely to volunteer in the future.","This past season I was supervising one paid undergraduate assistant while collecting my data as a graduate student. We were in remote locations in the Great Basin collecting seeds for three weeks. I talked about my communication style at the start of the season, and asked my assistant questions about her communication style, her personal boundaries, her experiences doing fieldwork, etc. We were also sharing a bedroom (not ideal for fieldwork/professional relationships!) so we had to have strong boundaries and spend a lot of time together. The first week was incredibly stressful because 1. we almost ran out of gas 2. we went up a scary hill in the truck then had to turn around and go back up it because we couldn't and 3. we couldn't find all of the populations we needed and I was worried that my project wasn't going to work. HOWEVER, I stayed calm the whole time, and tried not to show how stressed out I was. I said that even if we didn't get the seeds it wasn't the end of the world, and that our safety was more important than making my project work. After that first week we had much better luck, but I showed that I am competent and in control during the first week, which set us off to a good start.","I was leading a crew for the first time and we had huge goals to accomplish and I was prioritizing accomplishing the goals over my crew's comfort, and potentially their safety. Towards the end of the season they were pretty miserable, but we had a lot of work to do, and I stopped checking in with them and instead just tried to stay positive but push us to get the work done. Part of the problem is that they didn't understand that the field job required a lot of hiking, long days, and a lot of driving, which led them to have a bad attitude about fieldwork. The other part of the problem is that I was so obviously stressed out that I wasn't showing how fieldwork can be fun and rewarding - instead I was contributing to the negative environment. Some of the feedback I got at the end of the season was that I shouldn't have stopped out weekly or biweekly check ins, and that I should have stopped and talked about what we accomplished and celebrate out accomplishments instead of already striving for the next goal, because all in all, we accomplished a lot.","Communicate! Before the season starts, make sure you know about communication style, health and safety issues, and their levels of field experience. Have weekly check ins with each crew member individually. Try to maintain an air of calm and positivity, even when things are going wrong. As the leader, you set the mood for the group, so make sure to stay positive. Also, comfort and safety blur into each other, but if you crew is really uncomfortable it might become unsafe and remember that safety is more important than getting the work done.","Conservation Corps of New Mexico had some good resources in their trainings but I'm not sure if they're available online.","1. Crews should have wilderness first aid training! This is SO important and is often overlooked! If you don't have funding for it, then you probably shouldn't be sending people into the field if they haven't already been wilderness first aid certified.

If they don't want to work, they don't have to; they do the fun stuff and I do the hard work. The other two get accommodation for their preferences and desires, but I don't write off a sampling trip for anything unless it's objectively serious. I treat all crewmembers (undergrad, grad, paid) as though I was training them to do my job. If they're good and like the work, by the middle of the field season they can easily take over many of my tasks on an equal basis, which helps me out. For volunteers I keep the trips short and take extra care to provide good food and housing where appropriate, and do any onerous work in the background if possible.","The most important difference I can make is listening to the people I'm working with and making changes as they prefer. The more comfortable they are in how they spend their day, the better the work will go, so I try to identify work and life styles early so I can plan accordingly.","The most difficult problems I've run into were due to lack of attention to detail and supervision by me. When I requested a crew member to navigate while I worked on something else, we sometimes went to the wrong place. When I asked them to fill something in without verifying the first several, we got incorrectly filled forms. The lesson is to give crew jobs to do, but look over their shoulder from time to time to check it, before there's a problem. It's better to correct something as it goes wrong, than to do it over again afterward. This lack of attention also leads to frustration and irritation over the course of the day, which means less smooth work overall.","Initially, having a crew is extra work, not less work. When you're leading, you need to be both training and checking the work that gets done, so it'll feel like it's quicker and simpler to do it yourself anyway. Spend lots of time on the 'training' phase, and verify that they know exactly what they're doing. The crew won't start taking stuff of you're plate until you've shown them everything you know, so give it plenty of time. Afterward, if any of your crew is ambitious, you'll have a colleague, not an employee, and you can work on an equal footing, which is very relaxing. If your crew doesn't want the responsibility, you should at least have a competent worker and you can only check their work every once in a while. Always give opportunities for more responsibility, and encourage them to do more, more independently.","Get first aid training for yourself and your crew if possible. Wilderness first aid (16-hr course) is great both for the medical stuff, and because it teaches a mental framework of responsibility, preparation, and flexibility that's very applicable to all types of fieldwork.","No clue","In general, show your crew what you're doing and tell them why, even when you're doing admin work that doesn't really affect their job. They'll understand the project and what you're asking them to do much better. Always be willing to explain your reasoning, and listen to suggestions.

He would not listen to me when I asked, then demanded, that he not drink before driving into the field once every ~2 weeks. This turned into a very toxic, stressful dynamic that I did not handle very effectively. I tried many different tones and tactics to get him to comply, none of which really worked - and I couldn't afford to fire him and find someone else, because the training period had already ended and I couldn't spare the time on a tight field schedule to find someone new. I should have called on my PI earlier than I did to help me address the situation","Take a course in effective leadership styles! Having had zero formal training or much experience leading a team, especially in another country and language, before grad school made leading a field crew the most challenging part of my PhD. Figuring out what kind of leader to be, and what sort of relationship to foster with your crew members, is hard, but so important in shaping the crew dynamic. For example, I think I was too friendly and acted too much like a peer, which led to my crew members testing boundaries and not respecting my authority later on. Also, it's really important when working with local crew members in another country or culture to be prepared for cultural differences, and differences in expectations e.g. around things like money; try to consider power differences and how those might affect interpersonal dynamics.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01328-5 (Safe fieldwork strategies for at-risk individuals, their supervisors and institutions; Demery and Pipkin 2020)","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01328-5 (Safe fieldwork strategies for at-risk individuals, their supervisors and institutions; Demery and Pipkin 2020)","Setting boundaries and clear expectations at the beginning of the field season is so important.

This empowers the crew to make safety-based decisions. If possible, the crew should get some level of wilderness first aid training "," Ensure the crew has a check-in/check-out procedure and multiple parties are aware of their itinerary. Maintain positive relationships with crew members so they feel comfortable bringing up any safety concerns. ","Gestures of kindness go a long way towards building trust, a key component of promoting positive interpersonal relationships. The crew leader should be involved in some amount of pre-season safety training with a focus on the improtance of positive interpersonal communications in a field setting. ","Conduct regular debriefs after field work to find out what went well and what could have gone better. Making sure crew members don't feel overworked also goes a long way to ensuring safe working conditions and making sure field crew feel cared about. ","Assuming you have a good rapport with your field crew, it can be helpful to provide space for a final debrief to allow field crew members to voice their suggestions for making the next field season even better. A successful field crew leader will openly listen to these suggestions and give serious consideration to implementing/addressing the following field season. ","Most of the field staff I've supervised were underpaid interns (e.g., AmeriCorps) or volunteers. Basically, the less someone is getting paid, the more I ensure they are enjoying themselves and getting type of experience they want. Unfortunately, this meant I had to absorb more of the workload and was a sign that another paid staff member was needed to manage crew work. ","Incorporating lessons learned from previous three field seasons helped dial in logistics and pre-emptively respond to safety challenges. My best field seasons involved leaders who 1) had worked at least three seasons of field work previously, 2) were understanding of others who didn't have previous experience and took the time to teach them, 3) treated others with respect and kindness, 4) possessed some trait that brought a sense of lightness and even fun when field challenges arose","Not having the right equipment for the field conditions (e.g., vehicle w/o 4wd, poorly equipped tires). Another example would be having a field leader who was far less experienced than field technicians. ","Emphasize that safety and well-being is more important than data. Every time. ","Some type of first-aid training, Leave No Trace training, sexual harassment training with field focus - https://training.ucr.edu/courses/sexualharassment-field.

In terms of safety, everyone is the same, with some practical considerations for undergrads given different laws about chemical exposure, etc.","I would say all my field seasons have been successful, but have also been hard in different ways. I think having crew members who know how, or learn how, to support you and one another is the greatest form of success.","Interpersonal dynamics are always the hardest to manage. One time, despite clear communication about certain expectations, two crew members tried to argue against those expectations. These were expectations about norms of behavior--not workload or safety-related. That was really difficult and led to long-term resentments.","Choose your crew members wisely. Don't hire your friends. Prioritize safety first, then happiness, then the work. Think creatively about how to obtain useful data with minimal effort. Be sure to explore the various safety issues of your study area well in advance of the start of the season. Expect to do everything yourself, so that you're capable of stepping in when something is going wrong, no matter the situation.","I've really appreciated the recent literature on fieldwork safety for biologists of color and women.
