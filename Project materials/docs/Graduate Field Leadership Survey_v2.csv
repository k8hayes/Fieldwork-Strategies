I try to spread around tasks so that everyone can learn something new. For paid assistants, I still ask about their interests in terms of building skills, but I am more willing to ask them to work longer days or to do more challenging hikes.

","I was pressed for time, with dangerous weather coming in, but I had spent days planning and trying to get to the site to get the data. It was difficult to balance the need to get data with the safety of myself and my crew. We struck a good balance, getting most of the data but bailing before the lightning hazard became severe, but we were exhausted, cold, and wet by the time we got back to the campsite. ","Try to imagine everything that could go wrong, and prepare as if it will. Also, ask others for advice and help planning, and don't be afraid to show your crew that you care about their experience. They will respect you more for that.

As a crew we knew why we were collected our data and how (broadly) it would be used. Crew leads were on our side. ,Crew leads only cared about their own interest and not about the satisfaction of the crew. ,Be flexible and try to have fun.

Let local agencies or land owners know the crew will be conducting research and the timeframe for that research. 2) Verify the crew or field station will have access to full stocked first-aid kit as well as instructions to the nearest hospital. 3) Prepare any site or job specific warnings and recommendations for incoming field crews in advance so they will arrive prepared or aware of the risks/best practices for the challenges associated with the station.,1) Communicate expectations for behavior in emergencies to crews upon arrival and periodically throughout the season. 2) Make sure previously stocked aid and instructions remain present in field resources periodically throughout the season.,"1) Connect with group members prior to arrival and offer some resources to prepare them for the work. 2) Make a clear statement regarding expectations around interpersonal behavior and encourage open communication with yourself, the crew lead.","1) Have regular group meetings with the crew to update them on protocol changes, emergent issues, and give them all consistent guidance/support, (include as many members as is feasible). Ensure all crew members receive needed support and check in with them individually throughout the season. I find this promotes good morale, but also ensures consistency of field performance and quality data collection.","1) Performance reviews are helpful. Talking about what worked, what didn't work, and why can be hard during the field season, but we can learn a lot in reflection. I also encourage feedback about my leadership from my crew. 2) Debrief the crew and keep in touch regarding happenings with results of fieldwork (usually in the form of data summary).","I have no experience leading undergraduate students or graduate students. In the case of volunteers, I am usually more invested in making the experience worthwhile. I find out what interests them about the project and offer them opportunities whenever possible to get them involved in what sparks their curiosity. I think this should still be done with paid assistants, but their compensation means I expect them to be invested in all aspects of the project rather than cherry picking their favorites.",Being accessible and flexible given the challenges the crew encountered was crucial. Maintaining consistent contact and expectations was also critical. Being open and honest with the crew are definitely aspects of leading I think have worked well for me. ,"Thinking about a particularly challenging field season, the lack of access to resources seemed to augment interpersonal tension. Additionally, it made replacing resources that were initially available difficult leading to miscommunication and changing expectations. ","Embrace the experiences of the crew you work with. Make sure to communicate expectations as well as where the crew can access resources. If you care about the integrity of your data, the training and support of your crew is paramount to reliable data collection. If you are doing the hiring, make sure to ask questions related to challenges in the field and screen potential hires for the ability to work together and communicate.

However, I would hold everyone to the same data quality expectations. ",N/A,"The situation was made difficult because the season was VERY long, and circumstances dictated that we only got breaks and got to sleep in a bed/shower every 2-2.5 weeks. I think this wore on all of us and, despite the entire crew getting along fairly well, led to days fueled by frustration. Additionally, this was my first experience leading such a crew, so I was struggling to find my leadership style along with the pressure to collect valuable data. I had anticipated physical challenges, but I was not prepared to be the leader 24/7 (meaning making all the decisions-- from meals to camp set up-- and putting out interpersonal fires). ","Don't expect your crew to be as motivated to collect data as you-- they are there for experience and/or pay. Also, it is really important to set expectations prior to arriving at the field site- I recommend holding prep meeting to give an idea of 1) what life in the field will be like (housing and food situation, frequency of breaks, proximity to internet/town/stores), 2) what day-to-day work will encompass, and 3) what information it will be valuable to brush up on prior to arriving (i.e., species ID, skills, etc.).
